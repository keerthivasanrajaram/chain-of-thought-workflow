Universal V3 to V4 System Migration Workflow

This workflow is designed to be executed by a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze legacy system components and generate a comprehensive, actionable migration plan.

Prerequisites:

Before starting, gather the following components of your V3 system and rename them as follows for consistency throughout this workflow:

Datasources Definition: v3_datasources.json

Tasks/Form Definitions: v3_tasks.json

Questions/Field Definitions: v3_questions.json

Process/Workflow Logic: v3_processes.json

UI Pages & Widgets: v3_pages.json

Navigation/Application Shell: v3_navigation.json

Phase 1: Data & Foundation Layer Migration

This phase establishes the new data foundation by analyzing and planning the migration of datasources and the data-capture structures (forms).

Subtask 1: Datasource Migration

Objective: Analyze all V3 datasources, identify dependencies and breaking changes, and create a migration plan for a robust, V4-compatible data access layer.

**‚û°Ô∏è Prompt 1.1: Datasource Inventory Analysis**

**System Instruction:** You are a system migration analyst. Your task is to perform an initial inventory of all data sources from the provided V3 JSON file.

**User Prompt:**
"Analyze the provided `v3_datasources.json` file. Create a Markdown table that summarizes each datasource. The columns should be: `ID`, `Label`, `Type` (e.g., QUERY, SHEET), `Primary Source` (e.g., Sheet ID, Table Name), and `Parameters Used` (list all parameter keys from the configuration, noting their default values)."

**‚û°Ô∏è Prompt 1.2: Query Syntax & Pattern Recognition**

**System Instruction:** You are a database migration specialist. Your task is to analyze SQL queries for non-standard syntax and common patterns that may require special handling in a new system.

**User Prompt:**
"Using the full content of `v3_datasources.json` and the inventory from `chained-output/1.1-datasource-inventory.md`, perform a detailed analysis of each `QUERY` type datasource. Identify and list the following:
1.  **Platform-Specific SQL:** List any datasources using non-standard syntax (e.g., `::date` for casting, platform-specific date functions, proprietary array operators like `ANY()`).
2.  **Dynamic Filtering Patterns:** Note how parameters are used, especially common patterns for optional filters like `... WHERE (column = {{param}} OR {{param}} = 'All')`.
3.  **UI-Specific Patterns:** Identify queries that follow a `SELECT 'All' UNION ALL SELECT DISTINCT ...` pattern, typically used for populating filter dropdowns."

**‚û°Ô∏è Prompt 1.3: Generate V4 Datasource Migration Strategy**

**System Instruction:** You are a cloud solutions architect specializing in data systems. You have knowledge of both V3 and V4 architectures. Your task is to create a detailed, actionable migration plan.

**User Prompt:**
"Based on the datasource inventory (`1.1-datasource-inventory.md`) and the SQL analysis (`1.2-sql-analysis.md`), create a comprehensive migration plan. Assume the V4 system has the following constraints, which you can modify if needed:
- SQL syntax must be ANSI SQL compliant.
- Parameters are strongly typed and nulls must be handled explicitly (e.g., using `COALESCE` or `IS NULL`).
- Legacy `SHEET` type datasources must be migrated to a database table or a dedicated API endpoint.

For each datasource, create a new Markdown table with these columns: `V3 ID`, `V3 Label`, `V4 Migration Strategy`, `Rewritten V4 Query / Action`, and `Potential Issues & Notes`."

---

**üîÑ Feedback & Refinement Loop 1**

**User Prompt:**
"Review the generated plan in `1.3-datasource-migration-plan.md`.
- Are the rewritten SQL queries valid and efficient?
- Does the strategy for `SHEET` datasources make sense?
- For dynamic filtering patterns, is the proposed solution robust?

Provide a refinement prompt for a specific datasource, for example: 'Refine the query for datasource ID `[Example_ID]` (`[Example_Label]`) to improve performance by replacing the subquery with a Common Table Expression (CTE).'"
Subtask 2: Form & Field Migration

Objective: Convert V3 task and question definitions into a structured plan for creating modern, component-based V4 forms.

**‚û°Ô∏è Prompt 2.2: Identify Complex Form Logic & Components**

**System Instruction:** You are a UI/UX component specialist. Your task is to identify complex UI components and logic that will require custom implementation or careful mapping.

**User Prompt:**
"Using the full `v3_questions.json` file, identify all questions with complex configurations that will need special attention during migration. Create a 'Form Complexity Watchlist' table with columns for `Question ID`, `Question Title`, `Type`, and `Complexity Description`. Pay special attention to:
- Nested structures like `SUBGROUP` and `SUBFORM`.
- `DROPDOWN` fields that fetch data from legacy sources (`fetchFrom: 'SHEET'`).
- Any conditional visibility or logic defined in a `settings.conditions` array."

**User Prompt:**
"Using the task inventory (`2.1-task-question-inventory.md`), the complexity watchlist (`2.2-form-complexity-watchlist.md`), and the datasource migration plan (`1.3-datasource-migration-plan.md`), generate a detailed migration plan for each task. Assume V4 has a modern, component-based form builder. For each V3 task, provide:
- **V4 Form Name:** [v3 taskName]
- **V4 Form Fields (in a table):**
  - `V3 Question Title`
  - `V3 Question Type`
  - `Recommended V4 Component` (e.g., TextInput, DatePicker, Select, LocationPicker, FieldGroup, FileUpload)
  - `Configuration Notes` (For dropdowns, specify the **V4 Datasource** to link to. For nested structures, describe the nesting or suggest a reusable component strategy.)"

**üîÑ Feedback & Refinement Loop 2**

**User Prompt:**
"Review the form migration plan in `2.3-form-migration-plan.md`. For a task with complex nested logic (e.g., 'Add Customer'), provide a refinement prompt like: 'In the plan for the `[Example_Task_Name]` task, the `[Complex_Field_Type]` for `[Field_Title]` is used multiple times. Refine the plan to suggest creating a single reusable component in the V4 system for this logic.'"
Phase 2: Business Logic & Automation Migration

This phase translates the V3 process flows, which combine user tasks with backend automations, into a modern, declarative workflow structure.

Subtask 3: Process & Workflow Migration
